A genetic algorithm made for a BIOL 111 Project


This is a simple genetic algorithm I made as a part of a Biology 111 project at UBC.

It uses colours in the LAB colourspace to represent individuals in a population.

Right now it's a bit rough. I hope to clean this up so it's more accessible.

Right now you can change the settings in-code to see how that affects fitness. I'd like to build a front end to make this easier.

The benefit of using colours is that I can eventually make a nice visual representation.
